# Mini C to Python compiler
This is a mini compiler constructed as part of our Compiler Construction course for a subset of the C language (110072).

It was constructed in three incremental phases, each of which contributed a critical component of the compiler.

## Project 

| Phase   | Objective                                                                                                                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          |
| Phase 1 | Select a mini language and finding its specifications                                                                                                  |
| Phase 2 | A flex code file (well documented and commented) the takes as input a program in the language we selected in phase 1 and outputs its tokens with video |
| Phase 3 | Write YACC code that uses your code from phase 1 and translates a program written in programming language we chose in phase 1 to python code.          |
