# Phase 2  


This folder contains 3 files i.e.  

|Files         |
|------------  |
|1-Flex Code   |
|2-Symbol Table|
|3-Tokens      |  

The technique by which this programme works is that we named the files "Symbol Table" and "Tokens" which contain the code that we wrote in our "Flex Code," and the "Flex Code" file gives us output in the form of tokens.
